Train Scheduler App

The Train Schedule App allows you to view and add train schedules and times. This scheduler is for Florida Trains only.
The App works by providing a form where the user can input a new train's data, and 2 tables that display the Northbound and Southbound trains' information.
The train company can use this app to add and manage their trains in an organized fashion.
